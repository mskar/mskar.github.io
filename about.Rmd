# About me

My name is Martin Skarzynski.

I am a data scientist with a broad scientific background that ranges from molecular and cellular biology to population science.

I use the Python and R programming languages along with command line (shell) tools to explore, analyze, visualize and present data.

## Languages

I speak
- English,
- Polish,
- Russian,
- Spanish, and
- French

## Education

I hold
- an MPH in Epidemiologic and Biostatistical Methods for Public Health and Clinical Research and a certificate in Data Science from Johns Hopkins University,
- a PhD in Tumor Biology and a teaching certificate from Georgetown University,
- an MS in Biotechnology from Jagiellonian University in Poland, and
- a BA in Biology from St. Maryâ€™s College of Maryland.

## Mission Statement

My primary research interest is in understanding health risk factors by combining scientific expertise from diverse fields with machine intelligence.

I believe I am uniquely equipped to bridge the gaps between scientific disciplines and deliver on the promise of data science in health research.

My preferred tools are R and Python, open source programming languages kept on the cutting edge by their active and supportive communities.

Through research and teaching, I am constantly improving my ability to obtain, tidy, explore, transform, visualize, model, and communicate data.

I aim to utilize my technical skills and science background to become a leader among the next generation of multidisciplinary data scientists
