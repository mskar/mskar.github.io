# Greetings!👋

My name is Martin Skarzynski.

I am a data scientist👨‍🔬  and machine🤖  learning🧠  engineer with a broad scientific background that ranges from molecular and cellular biology to epidemiology.

I use the Python🐍  and R®️   programming languages along with UNIX shell🐚  tools🛠  to extract insights from data.

## Languages😛

I speak

- English🇺🇸
- French🇫🇷
- Polish🇵🇱
- Russian🇷🇺
- Spanish🇪🇸

## Education🎓

I hold

- an MPH in Epidemiologic and Biostatistical Methods for Public Health and Clinical Research and a certificate in Data Science from Johns Hopkins University,
- a PhD in Tumor Biology and a teaching certificate from Georgetown University,
- an MS in Biotechnology from Jagiellonian University in Poland, and
- a BA in Biology from St. Mary’s College of Maryland.

## Mission🚀

My primary research interest is in understanding health risk factors by combining scientific expertise from diverse fields with machine intelligence.

I believe I am uniquely equipped to bridge the gaps between scientific disciplines and deliver on the promise of data science in health research.

My preferred tools are Python and R, open source programming languages kept on the cutting edge by their active and supportive communities.

Through research and teaching, I am constantly improving my ability to obtain, tidy, explore, transform, visualize, model, and communicate data.

I aim to utilize my technical skills and science background to become a leader among the next generation of multidisciplinary data scientists
